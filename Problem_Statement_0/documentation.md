Problem Understanding

What the problem is asking: building a basic functioning calculator. with fundamental operators like addition, subraction, multiplication, division
power and square root

Key concepts involved: conditional statements, variable assignment 
My approach: since i am a beginner, i have used fundamentaly the conditional statement concept and havent used anything beyond

Conceptual Learning

new learnings: was introduced to claculating square roots in python and how to import files to perform pre-defined functions

my program first identifies the operators that the user wants to perform and alters the operations based on user inputs which has been
made feasible using the conditional statements
